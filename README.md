The official Cabin website, providing documentation, installation instructions, and references for the Cabin programming languages. This website is currently hosted with GitHub pages [here](https://cabin-lang.github.io).

## Contributing Notes

I'm not a web developer, and this project is a bit of a mess. It's a static website with no backend, and is deployed with an absolutely silly build script that probably can be done with a plethora of existing tools. Please forgive my ignorance.

This project doesn't use a front-end framework, just HTML, CSS, TypeScript, and jQuery (along with some basic element-sharing between pages).

I'm aware of the datedness of jQuery and that most of it's core usage and functionality is built into JavaScript now, but this website doesn't have enough going on to suffer in performance, and jQuery provides convenient syntax.
