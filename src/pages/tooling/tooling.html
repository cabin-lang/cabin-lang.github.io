			<h1>Tooling</h1>

			<p>
				In addition to the compiler itself, there are also a number of helpful tools to assist in Cabin development, such as the
				formatter, editor extensions, the language server, and more. Here, you can find all of the available tools for writing
				Cabin code.
			</p>

			<h2>Language Server</h2>

			<p>
				A <strong>language server</strong> provides diagnostics about your code &mdash; errors, warnings, suggestions, etc., as well as providing capabilities
				for code navigation, such as "go to definition", "go to type definition", etc. All of the ways that editors interact with your code in a way that feels
				like they <i>understand</i> the code is achieved through the language server protocol. The protocol defines a specific format to send and receive data in.
				Then, the system has two halves &mdash; the language server and language client. Both implement their sides of the protocol. The client would be your editor,
				something like Visual Studio Code or Neovim. The server is the Cabin language server tool. You perform an action in your editor, such as control-clicking for
				"go to definition"; Then, the editor (language client) formats this data as the protocol expects it and sends the request to the language server. The language
				server reads data according to the protocol format, and responds with the relevant information (the definition to jump to) also using the protocol.
			</p>

			<p>
				Before the days of LSP, every language needed a specialized plugin or extension for every editor to work properly, and developers would have to learn the
				specific API of each and every editor to integrate with. What you're left with is many editors missing support for many languages, and incomplete parity
				between extensions of different editors. the language server protocol creates a universal standard that most editors implement, allowing one tool to be written
				providing language support for all editors. If your editor shows errors and warnings, it most likely uses the language server protocol.
			</p>

			<p>
				Cabin has a Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation. Cabin's LSP is unique in that it doesn't actually provide extra diagnostics &mdash;
				the compiler already provides sufficiently thorough diagnostics; The LSP simply acts as an adapter to read compiler diagnostics and convert the
				result into the format expected by the protocol. You can install the language server as a standalone CLI tool, but most likely you should just install the extension
				for your specific editor, which will handle the installation and setup for you. To do so, continue below to your text editor. If you prefer the standalone CLI tool
				application, refer to the installation below.
			</p>

			<h2>Editor Plugins</h2>

			<p>
				Cabin has extensions and support for most major editors, including Visual Studio Code, Vim/Neovim, Emacs, and more.
			</p>

			<p>
				There's a Visual studio code extension for the Cabin programming language. The extension features semantic
				highlighting, language server protocol support including diagnostics, go to definition, etc., auto-formatting, and more.
			</p>

			<h3><img src="https://icons.iconarchive.com/icons/papirus-team/papirus-apps/512/nvim-icon.png"></img>Neovim</h3>

			<p>
				There is both a Vim plugin for Cabin and a Neovim plugin. While the Vim plugin works sufficiently well, the
				Neovim plugin takes advantage of Neovim's more advanced feature set and APIs, and if you're using Neovim, it is recommended to use the
				Neovim plugin over the standard Vim plugin.

			<h3><img src="https://zed.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fapp-logo.181f0a1a.png&w=640&q=75"></img>Zed</h3>

			<p>
				Zed is a relatively new editor compared to some other editors, and the plugin API is not quite as mature.
				Nonetheless, a Cabin extension exists providing similar features to the extensions for other editors, it may just be slightly less mature or
				robust currently.
