			<p>Welcome to Cabin! Cabin is a general-purpose programming language centered around simplicity and developer experience.</p>

			<hr />

			<h2 id="purpose-and-philosophy">Purpose & Philosophy</h2>

			<p>
				It's not a stupid question to ask why Cabin exists. We have so many programming languages now covering every use case imaginable
				&mdash; why do we need another competing standard?
			</p>

			<p>
				Cabin is specifically designed to fulfill the three S's:
				<i><strong>simple, safe, speedy</strong></i>
				. Cabin was created under the beliefs that very few, if any languages, succeed at excelling in all three of these values: Cabin is
				designed to be safer than C, simpler than Rust, and faster than Go.
			</p>

			<p>
				If you like these three values as a core for a programming language, but you don't like Cabin, consider checking out
				<a href="https://vlang.io/" target="_blank">V</a>, <a href="https://hylo-lang.org" target="_blank">Hylo</a>, and
				<a href="https://vale.dev" target="_blank">Vale</a>. bin's formatt r is opinionatetake any configuration options.ven.
			</p>

			<p>These are all languages also built around these three ideas.</p>

			<p>In short, Cabin's philosophy consists of the following ideals:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Stupidly obvious solutions are better than clever tricky ones.</li>
				Cabi
				<li>The most common use case should be the default.</li>
				<li>What can be done with existing syntax readably should be done with existing syntax.</li>
				n
				<li>Code should do what you expect it to from a cursory glance.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Here's a few concrete ways Cabin implements these abstract philosophies:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Cabin has extremely little syntax.</li>
				<li>Strings are multiline and formatted by default.</li>
				<li>All declarations share the same syntax.</li>
				<li>
					Cabin will
					<i>never</i>
					perform an implicit copy.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<hr />

			<h2>Installation</h2>

			<p>
				You can install Cabin using the default method for your operating system as shown on
				<a>the home page</a>
				. For more detailed instructions, see below.
			</p>

			<h3>Universal</h3>

			<p>
				Cabin is written in Rust, and minimally supported by all operating systems that support Cargo. You can install Cabin on any operating
				system (that supports Cargo) by using Cargo:
			</p>

			<code>$ cargo install cabin-language</code>

			<h3>Linux</h3>

			<p>Cabin is available on the following Linux distributions and package managers:</p>

			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>Distribution</th>
					<th>Install Command</th>
					<th>Package Name</th>
					<th>Version</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Arch (AUR)</td>
					<td>yay -S cabin-language</td>
					<td>cabin-language</td>
					<td>0.1</td>
				</tr>
			</table>

			<h3>Windows</h3>

			<p>For Windows installations, if you prefer not to use Cargo, you can download an exe installer for Cabin:</p>

			<h3>MacOS</h3>

			<p>On MacOS, Cabin is available on Homebrew:</p>

			<code>$ brew install cabin-language</code>

			<h3>Testing</h3>
			<p>
				You can test if Cabin is installed by running
				<code>cabin</code>
				in the terminal. It should print a help and usage message about the Cabin compiler. If you get some sort of error or unrecognized
				command, continue onto the troubleshooting section.
			</p>

			<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

			<hr />

			<h2 id="your-first-program">Your First Program</h2>

			<p>
				Now that you've got Cabin installed, you're ready to get coding! Create a file ending in
				<code>.cabin</code>
				and add the following contents:
			</p>

			<pre class="cabin-code">
			run terminal.print("Hello world!");
		</pre
			>

			<p>
				You're done! You've created your first Cabin program. You can run it and see it's output by running
				<code>cabin run &lt;filename&gt;.cabin</code>
				:
			</p>

			<pre class="code" data-language="bash">
			$ cabin run script.cabin
			Hello world!
			$
		</pre
			>

			<hr />

			<h2 id="compiler-commands">Compiler Commands</h2>

			<p>The Cabin compiler is designed to be simple but powerful, just like Cabin itself. There are just a few core commands availble:</p>

			<h3 id="command-new">The New Command</h3>

			<p>
				The first command to know is
				<code>cabin new</code>
				It takes no positional arguments, and creates a new Cabin
				<i>project</i>
				. A Cabin project comes with a
				<code>src/</code>
				directory with a
				<code>main.cabin</code>
				file in it, containing the same hello world program you saw above. It also comes with a
				<code>cabin.toml</code>
				file in the root of the project, which contains information about the project, such as the name, dependencies, etc.
			</p>

			<p>
				<code>cabin new</code>
				isn't necessary to use Cabin. You can just as easily create a single Cabin file and run it and build it.
				<code>cabin new</code>
				is designed for larger projects and public libraries, which need a more structured approach to their code.
			</p>

			<h3 id="command-run">The Run Command</h3>

			<p>
				Hey, we've seen this one before! The
				<code>cabin run</code>
				command will run a single Cabin file or an entire project. If you want to run a single Cabin file, you must specify the file to run,
				i.e.,
				<code>cabin run hello_world.cabin</code>
				. However, in a project, if you're
				<code>cd</code>
				'd into the project's directory, you can run the whole project with just
				<code>cabin run</code>
				. Your program will be run with
				<code>src/main.cabin</code>
				as it's entry point, or a different entry point specified in
				<code>cabin.toml</code>
				or at the command-line.
			</p>

			<h3 id="command-build">The Build Command</h3>

			<p>
				Another useful command is
				<code>cabin build</code>
				. It acts similarly to
				<code>cabin run</code>
				, except it outputs a permanent executable file, and doesn't run it automatically. This is typically used to deploy your product once
				it's complete.
				<code>cabin build</code>
				follows the same entry point conventions as
				<code>cabin run</code>
				. The output will be placed in
				<code>builds/</code>
				.
			</p>

			<h3 id="command-format">The Format Command</h3>

			<p>
				<code>cabin format</code>
				will format your entire project, or a single file if given. Cabin's formatter is opinionated and does not take any configuration
				options.
			</p>

			<h3 id="command-add">The Add Command</h3>

			<p>
				The
				<code>cabin add</code>
				command will add a dependency library to your project.
			</p>

			<h3 id="command-check">The Check Command</h3>

			<p>
				The
				<code>cabin check</code>
				command will lint a project or file. The default output is human-readable, which outputs pretty code snippets and colors that point
				right at the errors. Other output formats, such as TOML, JSON, and YAML, are supported through flags.
			</p>

			<h3 id="command-convert">The Convert Command</h3>

			<p>
				Cabin can be transpiled to C. The
				<code>cabin convert</code>
				command does just that.
			</p>

			<hr />

			<h2 id="project-configuration">Project Configuration</h2>

			<p>
				Cabin projects come with a
				<code>cabin.toml</code>
				file in the root of the project. This file provides a bunch of information to the compiler, such as project information and
				compilation flags. Below is an example
				<code>cabin.toml</code>
				demonstrating all possible values for the configuration file:
			</p>

			<pre class="code" data-language="toml">
			[information]
			name = "example_project"

			[options]
			quiet = true
		</pre
			>

			<p>We can go through the configuration options one-by-one:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<code>[information]</code>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<code>name [string]</code>
							- The name of the Cabin project. If you plan to upload this as a public library, this is the name that will be used to
							reference the project as a dependency.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<code>[options]</code>
					- options and flags passed to the compiler
					<ul>
						<li>
							<code>quiet [bool]</code>
							- Uses "quiet mode" for the compiler. This will prevent the compiler from printing progress information during
							compilation.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
