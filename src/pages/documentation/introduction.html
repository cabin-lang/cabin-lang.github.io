		<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

		<p>
			Welcome to Cabin! Cabin is a general-purpose programming language centered around simplicity and developer
			experience.
		</p>

		<hr />

		<h2 id="purpose-and-philosophy">Purpose & Philosophy</h2>

		<p>
			It's not a stupid question to ask why Cabin exists. We have so many programming languages now covering every
			use case imaginable &mdash; why do we need another competing standard?
		</p>

		<p>
			Cabin is specifically designed to fulfill the three S's: <i><strong>simple, safe, speedy</strong></i>. Cabin
			was created under the beliefs that very few, if any languages, succeed at excelling in all three of these
			values: Cabin is designed to be safer than C, simpler than Rust, and faster than Go.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you like these three values as a core for a programming language, but you don't like Cabin, consider
			checking out <a href="https://vlang.io/">the V programming language</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			In short, Cabin's philosophy consists of the following ideals:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Stupidly obvious solutions are better than clever tricky ones.</li>
			<li>The most common use case should be the default.</li>
			<li>What can be done with existing syntax readably should be done with existing syntax.</li>
			<li>Code should do what you expect it to from a cursory glance.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			Here's a few concrete ways Cabin implements these abstract philosophies:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Cabin has extremely little syntax.</li>
			<li>Strings are multiline and formatted by default.</li>
			<li>All declarations share the same syntax.</li>
			<li>Cabin will <i>never</i> perform an implicit copy.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Installation</h2>

		<p>
			You can install Cabin using the default method for your operating system as shown on <a>the home page</a>.
			For more detailed instructions, see below.
		</p>

		<h3>Universal</h3>

		<p>
			Cabin is written in Rust, and minimally supported by all operating systems that support Cargo. You can
			install Cabin on any operating system (that supports Cargo) by using Cargo:
		</p>

		<code>
			$ cargo install cabin-language
		</code>

		<h3>Linux</h3>

		<p>
			Cabin is available on the following Linux distributions and package managers:
		</p>

		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Distribution</th>
				<th>Install Command</th>
				<th>Package Name</th>
				<th>Version</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Arch (AUR)</td>
				<td>yay -S cabin-language</td>
				<td>cabin-language</td>
				<td>0.1</td>
			</tr>
		</table>

		<h3>Windows</h3>

		<p>For Windows installations, if you prefer not to use Cargo, you can download an exe installer for Cabin:</p>

		<h3>MacOS</h3>

		<p>
			On MacOS, Cabin is available on Homebrew:
		</p>

		<code>
			$ brew install cabin-language
		</code>

		</h3>Testing</h3>
		<p>
			You can test if Cabin is installed by running <code>cabin</code> in the terminal. It should print a help and
			usage message about the Cabin compiler. If you get some sort of error or unrecognized command, continue onto
			the troubleshooting section.
		</p>

		<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

		<hr />

		<h2 id="your-first-program">Your First Program</h2>

		<p>
			Now that you've got Cabin installed, you're ready to get coding! Create a file ending in <code>.cabin</code>
			and add the following contents:
		</p>

		<pre class="cabin-code">
			run terminal.print("Hello world!");
		</pre>

		<p>
			You're done! You've created your first Cabin program. You can run it and see it's output by running
			<code>cabin run &lt;filename&gt;.cabin</code>:
		</p>

		<pre class="code" data-language="bash">
			$ cabin run script.cabin
			Hello world!
			$
		</pre>

		<hr />

		<h2 id="compiler-commands">Compiler Commands</h2>

		<p>
			The Cabin compiler is designed to be simple but powerful, just like Cabin itself. There are just a few core
			commands availble:
		</p>

		<h3>The New Command</h3>

		<p>
			The first command to know is <code>cabin new</code> It takes no positional arguments, and creates a new
			Cabin <i>project</i>. A Cabin project comes with a <code>src/</code> directory with a
			<code>main.cabin</code> file in it, containing the same hello world program you saw above. It also comes
			with a <code>cabin.toml</code> file in the root of the project, which contains information about the
			project, such as the name, dependencies, etc.
		</p>

		<p>
			<code>cabin new</code> isn't necessary to use Cabin. You can just as easily create a single Cabin file and
			run it and build it. <code>cabin new</code> is designed for larger projects and public libraries, which need
			a more structured approach to their code.
		</p>

		<h3>The Run Command</h3>

		<p>
			Hey, we've seen this one before! The <code>cabin run</code> command will run a single Cabin file or an
			entire project. If you want to run a single Cabin file, you must specify the file to run, i.e.,
			<code>cabin run hello_world.cabin</code>. However, in a project, if you're <code>cd</code>'d into the
			project's directory, you can run the whole project with just <code>cabin run</code>. Your program will be
			run with <code>src/main.cabin</code> as it's entry point, or a different entry point specified in
			<code>cabin.toml</code> or at the command-line.
		</p>

		<hr />

		<h2 id="project-configuration">Project Configuration</h2>

		<p>
			Cabin projects come with a <code>cabin.toml</code> file in the root of the project. This file provides a
			bunch of information to the compiler, such as project information and compilation flags. Below is an example
			<code>cabin.toml</code> demonstrating all possible values for the configuration file:
		</p>

		<pre class="code" data-language="toml">
			[information]
			name = "example_project"

			[options]
			quiet = true
		</pre>

		<p>
			We can go through the configuration options one-by-one:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<code>[information]</code>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<code>name [string]</code> - The name of the Cabin project. If you plan to upload this as a
						public
						library, this is the name that will be used to reference the project as a dependency.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<code>[options]</code> - options and flags passed to the compiler
				<ul>
					<li>
						<code>quiet [bool]</code> - Uses "quiet mode" for the compiler. This will prevent the compiler
						from printing progress information during compilation.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
