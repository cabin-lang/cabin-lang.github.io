			<h2 id="names">Names</h2>

			<p>
				In Cabin, we call variables <i>names</i>. This is because names are often unchanging, and therefore by definition, not variable. Names
				can be declared with the <code>let</code> keyword, for example:
			</p>

			<pre class="code" data-language="cabin">
				let message = "Hello world!";
			</pre
			>

			<p>Names always <i>reference</i> a value. Two names can reference the same value!</p>

			<pre class="code" data-language="cabin">
				let message = "Hello world!";
				let message2 = message;
			</pre
			>

			<p>
				In this example, changing the value of either name will also change the value of another name. However, Cabin won't actually let you
				write this implicitly. You can't <i>directly</i> assign one name to another, you need to specify if you want to reference it or copy
				it.
			</p>

			<pre class="code" data-language="cabin">
				let message = "Hello world!";
				let message2 = message; // This isn't valid!
				let message3 = message.copy(); // This IS valid!
				let message4 = message.reference(); // This is also valid!
			</pre
			>

			<p>
				The <code>reference</code> function exists on all values, and it actually does nothing! This can seem somewhat silly, but it conveys
				intention and prevents you from misunderstanding assignments. Cabin will not let you raw assign a name to a name, because it could
				cause confusion as to what's happening.
			</p>

			<hr />

			<h2>Objects</h2>

			<p>Objects are groups of values. In Cabin, you can create an object with the <code>new</code> keyword:</p>

			<pre class="code" data-language="cabin">
			let john = new Object {
				name = "John",
				age = 30,
				address = new Object {
					street = "Main St",
					house = 123
				}
			};
		</pre
			>

			<p>You can access names of this object with <code>.</code> syntax:</p>

			<pre class="code" data-language="cabin">
			let john = new Object {
				name = "John",
				age = 30,
				address = new Object {
					street = "Main St",
					house = 123
				}
			};

			terminal.print(john.name); // John
			terminal.print(john.address.street); // Main St
		</pre
			>
		</main>
