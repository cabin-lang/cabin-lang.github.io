			<h1>Groups</h1>

			<p>
				A <code>group</code> defines a blueprint for grouping values together. It is similar to a <code>struct</code> in many other languages,
				or in some ways a <code>class</code> in some others. Here's an example of a <code>group</code> declaration:
			</p>

			<pre class="code" data-language="cabin">
				let Person = group {
					name: Text,
					age: Number,
					is_married: Boolean
				};
			</pre
			>

			<p>
				This follows the same syntax to all declarations in Cabin &mdash; <code>let &lt;name&gt; = &lt;value&gt;</code>. Note that by
				convention, groups are one of the few cases where we write our name in PascalCase instead of snake_case. Groups can be "instantiated"
				using the <code>new</code> keyword:
			</p>

			<pre class="code" data-language="cabin">
				let Person = group {
					name: Text,
					age: Number,
					is_married: Boolean
				};

				let john = new Person {
					name = "john",
					age = 30,
					is_married = false
				};
			</pre
			>

			<p>
				Notice how we only assign properties that are listed in <code>Person</code>. This is required; Cabin doesn't allow assigning arbitrary
				properties:
			</p>

			<pre class="code" data-language="cabin">
				let Person = group {
					name: Text,
					age: Number,
					is_married: Boolean
				};

				let john = new Person {
					name = "john",
					age = 30,
					is_married = false,
					best_friend: "jacob" // Error! No field "best_friend" on "Person"
				};
			</pre
			>

			<p>By the way, the properties at instation don't have to be in the same order as the declaration. For example, this is just as valid:</p>

			<pre class="code" data-language="cabin">
				let Person = group {
					name: Text,
					age: Number,
					is_married: Boolean
				};

				let john = new Person {
					age = 30,
					is_married = false,
					name = "john",
				};
			</pre
			>

			<p>
				Groups can also have default values assigned to their fields. These are fields where you don't have to pass a value at the time of
				instantiation and a default will be used.
			</p>

			<pre class="code" data-language="cabin">
				let Person = group {
					name: Text,
					age: Number,
					is_married = false
				};

				let john = new Person {
					age = 30,
					name = "john",
				}; // is_married defaults to false
			</pre
			>

			<p>Furthermore, we can retrieve the fields on the group with the "dot" operator:</p>

			<pre class="code" data-language="cabin">
				let Person = group {
					name: Text,
					age: Number,
					is_married: Boolean
				};

				let john = new Person {
					name = "john",
					age = 30,
					is_married = false
				};

				terminal.print(john.name); // Prints john!
			</pre
			>

			<p>
				Group fields are not <code>editable</code> by default. We'll talk more about <code>editable</code> soon, but basically it means that
				you can't change the values of the group's fields. So, this would be invalid:
			</p>

			<pre class="code" data-language="cabin">
				let Person = group {
					name: Text,
					age: Number,
					is_married: Boolean
				};

				let john = new Person {
					name = "john",
					age = 30,
					is_married = false
				};

				john.name = "mary"; // compiler error! `name` is not `editable`.
			</pre
			>

			<p>To fix this, we need to make the field have an <code>editable</code> type:</p>

			<pre class="code" data-language="cabin">
				let Person = group {
					name: editable Text,
					age: Number,
					is_married: Boolean
				};

				let john: editable = new Person {
					name = "john",
					age = 30,
					is_married = false
				};

				john.name = "mary"; // This works now!
			</pre
			>

			<p>This also applies to default fields. So this isn't valid:</p>

			<pre class="code" data-language="cabin">
				let Person = group {
					name: editable Text,
					age: Number,
					is_married = false
				};

				let john: editable = new Person {
					name = "john",
					age = 30,
					is_married = true // Error! `is_married` is already assigned and not `editable`
				};
			</pre
			>

			<p>Naturally, this problem has the same solution:</p>

			<pre class="code" data-language="cabin">
				let Person = group {
					name: editable Text,
					age: Number,
					is_married: editable Boolean = false
				};

				let john: editable = new Person {
					name = "john",
					age = 30,
					is_married = true // All good!
				};
			</pre
			>

			<p>
				Again, don't worry too much about this &mdash; We'll talk more about <code>editable</code> in a little bit. After reading about
				<code>editable</code> you can always come back here to digest this more.
			</p>

			<hr />

			<h2>Nominal Typing</h2>

			<p>
				Cabin is a <i>nominally</i> typed language. This means that just because two groups have the same structure, you can't assign one to a
				type of another. For example:
			</p>

			<pre class="code" data-language="cabin">
				let Group1 = group { data: Text };
				let Group2 = group { data: Text };

				let instance: Group1 = new Group2 { data = "Hi!"}; // Invalid!
			</pre
			>

			<p>
				In a little bit, we'll talk about <code>represent-as</code> declarations which allow for polymorphism. For now, just understand that
				even if two groups look the same, they may still be distinct.
			</p>

			<hr />

			<h2>Compile-Time Parameters</h2>

			<p>
				Groups can take <i>compile-time parameters</i>. These are essetially fields that must be instantiated in the group, but they're
				positional instead of named, and the value passed to them must be a <i>type</i>, by Cabin's definition (we'll talk more about types
				later). Here's an example:
			</p>

			<pre class="code" data-language="cabin">
				let Node = group&lt;Data&gt; {
					data: Data
				};

				let number_node = new Node&lt;Number&gt; {
					data = 10
				};
			</pre
			>

			<hr />

			<h2>The Object Type</h2>

			<p>
				<code>Object</code> is a special group because the compiler knows about it and treats it specially. <code>Object</code> is used to
				create "anonymous" objects without an existing group as it's type:
			</p>

			<pre class="code" data-language="cabin">
				let john = new Object {
					name = "john",
					age = 30,
					is_married = true
				};
			</pre
			>

			<p>
				You can put whatever fields you want in here, but note that <i>it's still strictly type checked.</i> You can think of it as similar to
				a TypeScript object. The above is loosely equivalent to this:
			</p>

			<pre class="code" data-language="cabin">
				let _JohnGroup = group {
					name: Text,
					age: Number,
					is_married: Boolean
				};

				let john = new _JohnGroup {
					name = "john",
					age = 30,
					is_married = true
				};
			</pre
			>

			<p>
				So you still can't access arbitrary fields on this object, and you can't add new fields to it when you mutate it. When
				<code>Object</code> is used as a type, it means anything can be assigned to it:
			</p>

			<pre class="code" data-language="cabin">
				let do_something = action(object: Object) {
					// ...
				};

				// These are all valid!
				do_something(3);
				do_something("Hi!");
				do_something(john);
			</pre
			>

			<p>
				The reason why <code>do_something</code> doesn't have an example body here is because there's not much you can do with
				<code>Object</code> outside of some type inspection. You can't access arbitrary fields on it; It's sort of like
				<code>unknown</code> in TypeScript, and <i>not</i> like <code>any</code>.
			</p>

			<hr />

			<h2>Represent-As Declarations</h2>

			<p>
				Represent-as declarations are Cabin's way of allowing polymorphism. The concept is very simple: You can <i>represent</i> one group
				<i>as</i> another. Let's look at a simple example where we want to create an interface-like structure. Say we want an action that can
				take anything with a parameter-less <code>do</code> action:
			</p>

			<pre class="code" data-language="cabin">
				let run_twice = action(runnable: Runnable) {
					runnable.do();
					runnable.do();
				};
			</pre
			>

			<p>
				So we need to define a <code>Runnable</code> "interface" that can accomplish this. In Cabin, that'd just be a group like everything
				else:
			</p>

			<pre class="code" data-language="cabin">
				let Runnable = group {
					do: action(this: This)
				};
			</pre
			>

			<p>
				Now, we can take any other group and <i>represent</i> it as <code>Runnable</code>. This just involves implementing the required
				fields:
			</p>

			<pre class="code" data-language="cabin">
				let Runnable = group {
					do: action(this: This)
				};

				let ExisingGroup = group {
					data: Text
				};

				represent ExistingGroup as Runnable {
					do = action(this: This) {
						terminal.print(this.data);
					}
				};
			</pre
			>

			<p>Now, objects of type <code>ExistingGroup</code> can be assigned to names of type <code>Runnable</code>:</p>

			<pre class="code" data-language="cabin">
				let existing_group_instance = new ExisingGroup {
					data = "Done!";
				};

				run_twice(existing_group_instance);
			</pre
			>

			<p>
				Uniquely, it's important to note here that <code>existing_group_instance</code> is <i>not</i> getting "coerced" into a
				<code>Runnable</code> here. It's concrete type is still passed to the action &mdash; meaning we can still use the various operations
				to get it's actual type:
			</p>

			<pre class="code" data-language="cabin">
				let existing_group_instance = new ExisingGroup {
					data = "Done!";
				};

				let inspect = action(runnable: Runnable) {
					foreach field in runnable.type.fields {
						terminal.print(field.name);
					};
				};

				inspect(existing_group_instance); // Prints "data"!
			</pre
			>

			<p>
				As we can see here, the type information about <code>existing_group_instance</code> is retained into the function call. Remember, in
				Cabin, the explicit type annotation on a name (including a parameter) does not mean "what is this thing?" it means "what can this
				thing be assigned to?".
